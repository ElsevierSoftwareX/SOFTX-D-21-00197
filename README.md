# StrutSurf
A tool for analysis of strut morphology and surface roughness in additively manufactured lattices

StrutSurf is written in MATLAB and requires  MATLAB (to run the source code) or the MATLAB Runtime environment (to run the executable installer).


**Executable Installer**

Prerequisites for Deployment 

Verify that version 9.9 (R2020b) of the MATLAB Runtime is installed.   
If not, you can download and install the Windows version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2020b 
from the following link on the MathWorks website:

    https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html
   
For more information about the MATLAB Runtime and the MATLAB Runtime installer, see 
"Distribute Applications" in the MATLAB Compiler documentation  
in the MathWorks Documentation Center.


**Running from source code**

If you already have MATLAB installed, you can run StrutSurf from the main file StrutSurf.m
