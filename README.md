# StrutSurf
A tool for analysis of strut morphology and surface roughness in additively manufactured lattices

StrutSurf is written in MATLAB and requires the MATLAB Runtime environment.

Prerequisites for Deployment 

Verify that version 9.9 (R2020b) of the MATLAB Runtime is installed.   
If not, you can run the MATLAB Runtime installer.
To find its location, enter
  
    >>mcrinstaller
      
at the MATLAB prompt.
NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run the MATLAB Runtime installer. 

Alternatively, download and install the Windows version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2020b 
from the following link on the MathWorks website:

    https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html
   
For more information about the MATLAB Runtime and the MATLAB Runtime installer, see 
"Distribute Applications" in the MATLAB Compiler documentation  
in the MathWorks Documentation Center.


If you already have MATLAB installed, you can run StrutSurf from the main file StrutSurf.m
